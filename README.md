# Simple-Calculator:

This Python code implements a simple calculator that can perform the following operations:

    Addition
    Subtraction
    Multiplication
    Division
    Modulus

The user can choose the operation they want to perform by entering a number from 1 to 5. The code then prompts the user to enter two numbers. The result of the operation is then displayed on the screen.

The code also includes some error handling to prevent the user from entering invalid input. For example, if the user enters a number that is not between 1 and 5, the code will display an error message and prompt the user to enter a valid number.

Here is an example of how the code would be used:


    0-Quitter
    1-addition
    2-sustraction
    3-multiplication
    4-division
    5-Mod
    choisir une operation: 1
    saisir nombre 1: 10
    saisir nombre 2: 5
    la somme de 10 et 5 est: 15
